    <h3>This recipe is for the classic Fettuccine Alfredo. You can leave it as is or add your favorite form of protein - chicken, beef, or seafood!</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove (minced)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons italian parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>Bechamel Sauce</h5>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from hot plate; add the flour and whisk for about 30 seconds, or until well blended.</li>
        <li>lace pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low and slowly whisk in 1 cup of the milk until well combined. Once well blended, add the remaining milk in 1 cup increments, mixing well after each addition, until all the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns into a nice and creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium and continue cooking sauce while stirring occasionally until it thickens (about 6-7 minutes) and coats the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Add in the parmesan cheese and remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper and mix until the cheese is melted through.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>Assemble!</h5>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F | 180°F.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 cup of meat sauce on the base of a 9x13-inch baking dish, then cover with lasagna sheets. (Trim sheets to fit over the meat if needed.) Layer with 2 cups of meat sauce (or enough to cover pasta), 1 cup of white sauce and half of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers (leaving the remaining cheese for the top).</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining meat sauce and white sauce over the last layer of lasagna sheets and top with the remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and let stand for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
